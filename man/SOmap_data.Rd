  \item CCAMLR_SSMU
    \itemize{
      \item Description: Small-scale management units (SSMUs) are designed to be used as a basis for subdividing the precautionary catch limit for krill in Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4, and in developing management procedures for the krill fishery that can adequately account for localised effects on krill predators (SC-CAMLR-XXI, paragraphs 3.16 to 3.18). The boundaries of the SSMUs are based on predator foraging ranges (refer SC-CAMLR-XXI, Annex 4 and Trathan et al, 2008).

  \item CCAMLR_SSRU
    \itemize{
      \item Description: Small-scale research units (SSRUs) are designed to be used as a basis for subdividing the precautionary catch limit for toothfish in exploratory fisheries, and in condcuting research fishing and developing stock assessments. The boundaries of the SSRUs are defined in Conservation Measure 41-01 (2013). CCAMLR Secretariat (2013).

  \item CCAMLR_statistical_areas
    \itemize{
      \item Description: Statistical areas, subareas and divisions are used globally for the purpose of reporting fishery statistics. CCAMLR's Convention Area in the Southern Ocean is divided, for statistical purposes, into Area 48 (Atlantic Antarctic) between 70W and 30E, Area 58 (Indian Ocean Antarctic) between 30 and 150E, and Area 88 (Pacific Antarctic) between 150E and 70W. These areas, which are further subdivided into subareas and divisions, are managed by CCAMLR.

  \item CCAMLR_planning_domains
    \itemize{
      \item Description: Nine planning domains were defined during the 2011 CCAMLR workshop on marine protected areas (SC-CAMLR-XXX, Annex 6). These planning domains provide comprehensive coverage of bioregions in the Southern Ocean and may be used as reporting and auditing units for work related to the development of MPAs and as a means to organise future activities related to this effort.

Included are the EEZs that intersect the CCAMLR convention area. Some of these are currently in dispute.
